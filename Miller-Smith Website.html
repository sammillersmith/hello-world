    <h1>...About size!!!</h1> 

    <h5>Size is the magnitude or dimensions of a thing. Size can be measured as length, width, 
    height, diameter, perimeter, area, volume, or mass. <br>

    This animation gives a sense of the scale of some of the known objects in our universe.
    In mathematical terms, "size is a concept abstracted from the process of measuring by 
    comparing a longer to a shorter".[1] Size is determined by the process of comparing or 
    measuring objects, which results in the determination of the magnitude of a quantity, 
    such as length or mass, relative to a unit of measurement. Such a magnitude is usually 
    expressed as a numerical value of units on a previously established spatial scale, such 
    as meters or inches.<br>
    The sizes with which humans tend to be most familiar are body dimensions (measures of 
    anthropometry), which include measures such as human height, and human body weight. 
    These measures can, in the aggregate, allow the generation of commercially useful 
    distributions of products that accommodate expected body sizes,[2] as with the creation 
    of clothing sizes and shoe sizes, and with the standardization of door frame dimensions, 
    ceiling heights, and bed sizes. The human experience of size can lead to a psychological 
    tendency towards size bias,[3] wherein the relative importance or perceived complexity of 
    organisms and other objects is judged based on their size relative to humans, and 
    particularly whether this size makes them easy to observe without aid.</h5>
